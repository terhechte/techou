- support for multiple "books"
- books contain (like mdbook) a folder structure and a main .md file that shows the structure (like mdbook)
- add support for my mdbook extensions for various markdown parsings
- use techou as a library for this (temporary, a local)
- improve the parsing speed for MD (see appventure)
